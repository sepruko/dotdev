Hello, I'm {DotDev.entity.full_name}. I'm a silly internet kitty from Australia,
who loves to tinker with code and create fun little projects. Most of my
development experience lies in web-development, but I've also branched out to
other languages like Zig and Go for writing small programs that run outside the
browser.

I've not much else to write here, but maybe I'll think of something.
